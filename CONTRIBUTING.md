# Contributing to DevSecOps Portfolio

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this DevSecOps portfolio! This document provides guidelines and best practices for contributing to ensure high-quality, secure, and maintainable code.

## ü§ù How to Contribute

### 1. Getting Started

#### Prerequisites
- **Git**: Version 2.30 or higher
- **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher
- **Python**: Version 3.9 or higher  
- **Docker**: Version 20.10 or higher
- **Terraform**: Version 1.6 or higher
- **kubectl**: Version 1.28 or higher

#### Development Environment Setup
```bash
# 1. Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/devsecops.git
cd devsecops

# 2. Install pre-commit hooks
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# 4. Run initial security scan
./scripts/security-scan.sh

# 5. Verify setup
npm run test
terraform validate infrastructure/terraform/
```

### 2. Development Workflow

#### Branch Strategy
We follow a **GitFlow** workflow with security-first practices:

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# For security fixes
git checkout -b security/vulnerability-fix

# For infrastructure changes  
git checkout -b infra/terraform-updates

# For documentation
git checkout -b docs/update-readme
```

#### Commit Convention
We use **Conventional Commits** specification:

```bash
# Format: <type>[optional scope]: <description>
git commit -m "feat(api): add rate limiting middleware"
git commit -m "fix(security): resolve SQL injection vulnerability"
git commit -m "docs(readme): update installation guide"
git commit -m "sec(deps): update vulnerable package versions"
```

**Commit Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `sec`: Security-related changes
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Formatting, missing semi colons, etc.
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding missing tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- `ci`: CI/CD pipeline changes
- `infra`: Infrastructure changes

### 3. Security Requirements

#### Security Checklist
Before submitting any contribution, ensure:

- [ ] **No secrets** in code (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- [ ] **Dependencies** are updated and vulnerability-free
- [ ] **SAST** scans pass with no high/critical issues
- [ ] **Container images** are scanned and secure
- [ ] **Infrastructure code** follows security best practices
- [ ] **Tests** include security test cases
- [ ] **Documentation** includes security considerations

#### Pre-commit Security Hooks
Our pre-commit hooks automatically run:

```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml (excerpt)
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog
    hooks:
      - id: trufflehog
  
  - repo: https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets
    hooks:
      - id: detect-secrets

  - repo: https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov
    hooks:
      - id: checkov
        args: [--framework, terraform, --framework, kubernetes]
```

#### Security Testing
```bash
# Run comprehensive security tests
npm run security:test

# Specific security scans
npm run security:sast     # Static analysis
npm run security:deps     # Dependency scanning  
npm run security:secrets  # Secret detection
npm run security:containers # Container scanning
npm run security:iac      # Infrastructure scanning
```

### 4. Code Quality Standards

#### Code Style and Linting
```bash
# JavaScript/TypeScript
npm run lint
npm run format

# Python  
flake8 .
black .
isort .
mypy .

# Terraform
terraform fmt -recursive
tflint
```

#### Testing Requirements
- **Unit tests**: Minimum 80% coverage
- **Integration tests**: All API endpoints
- **Security tests**: All security controls
- **End-to-end tests**: Critical user flows

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:all

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Security-specific tests
npm run test:security
```

### 5. Documentation Standards

#### Required Documentation
For any contribution, please ensure:

1. **Code Documentation**
   ```javascript
   /**
    * Validates user input for security vulnerabilities
    * @param {string} input - User input to validate
    * @param {Object} options - Validation options
    * @param {boolean} options.allowHtml - Whether to allow HTML
    * @returns {Object} Validation result with sanitized input
    * @throws {SecurityError} When input contains malicious content
    * @security Prevents XSS and injection attacks
    */
   function validateInput(input, options = {}) {
     // Implementation
   }
   ```

2. **Security Documentation**
   - Threat model updates
   - Security control descriptions
   - Risk assessments
   - Compliance mappings

3. **Architecture Documentation**
