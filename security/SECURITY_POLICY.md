# Security Policies and Procedures

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Policy Framework

This document outlines the comprehensive security policies implemented in this DevSecOps portfolio, following industry best practices and international standards.

## üìã Compliance Standards

### Primary Standards
- **OWASP Top 10 2021** - Web Application Security Risks
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** - Risk Management Framework
- **CIS Controls v8** - Critical Security Controls
- **ISO 27001:2013** - Information Security Management
- **SOC 2 Type II** - Security, Operational & Compliance Controls

### Regulatory Compliance
- **GDPR** - General Data Protection Regulation
- **SOX** - Sarbanes-Oxley Act
- **PCI DSS** - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
- **HIPAA** - Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act

## üîê Security Controls

### 1. Identity and Access Management (IAM)

#### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- **Requirement**: MFA mandatory for all privileged accounts
- **Implementation**: GitHub, AWS, Azure AD integration
- **Audit**: Monthly access reviews and privilege attestation

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
```yaml
# Example RBAC Configuration
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: production
  name: developer-role
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods", "services"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
- apiGroups: ["apps"]
  resources: ["deployments"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "update", "patch"]
```

#### Principle of Least Privilege
- Minimum required permissions for each role
- Time-bound access for temporary elevated privileges
- Regular access audits and cleanup

### 2. Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

#### Pre-Commit Security
```bash
# Pre-commit hooks configuration
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog
    rev: v3.63.2
    hooks:
      - id: trufflehog
        name: TruffleHog
        description: Detect secrets in your data.
        entry: bash -c 'trufflehog git file://. --since-commit HEAD --only-verified --fail'
        language: system
        stages: ["push"]
```

#### Security Gates in CI/CD
1. **SAST** - Static Application Security Testing
2. **DAST** - Dynamic Application Security Testing  
3. **SCA** - Software Composition Analysis
4. **Container Scanning** - Image vulnerability assessment
5. **IaC Security** - Infrastructure as Code validation

### 3. Data Protection

#### Data Classification
| Level | Description | Examples | Controls |
|-------|-------------|----------|----------|
| Public | Information that can be shared publicly | Marketing materials, public documentation | Standard backup |
| Internal | Information for internal use only | Business processes, internal communications | Access controls |
| Confidential | Sensitive business information | Customer data, financial records | Encryption at rest/transit |
| Restricted | Highly sensitive information | PII, payment data, secrets | Strong encryption, strict access |

#### Encryption Standards
- **At Rest**: AES-256 encryption for all data storage
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communication
- **Key Management**: Hardware Security Modules (HSM) or cloud KMS

#### Data Retention Policy
```yaml
# Data Retention Configuration
retention_policies:
  application_logs: 90d
  audit_logs: 7y
  backup_data: 1y
  test_data: 30d
  user_data: per_gdpr_requirements
```

### 4. Network Security

#### Network Segmentation
```yaml
# Network Policy Example
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: deny-all-ingress
  namespace: production
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress: []  # Deny all ingress traffic by default
```

#### Zero Trust Architecture
- Default deny network policies
- Micro-segmentation between services
- Continuous verification of network traffic
- Identity-based access controls

### 5. Container Security

#### Base Image Security
```dockerfile
# Secure base image selection
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
# Use specific version tags, not 'latest'

# Non-root user
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs
RUN adduser -S nextjs -u 1001
USER nextjs

# Security scanning in Dockerfile
RUN npm audit --audit-level=moderate
```

#### Runtime Security
- Container immutability
- Resource limits and quotas
- Security contexts and capabilities
- Regular image updates and patching

### 6. Secrets Management

#### Secret Classification
```yaml
# Secret types and handling
secret_types:
  api_keys:
    storage: vault
    rotation: 90d
    access: service_account_only
  
  database_credentials:
    storage: cloud_kms
    rotation: 30d
    access: application_only
  
  certificates:
    storage: cert_manager
    rotation: 365d
    access: ingress_only
```

#### Secret Rotation Policy
- **API Keys**: 90 days
- **Database Passwords**: 30 days
- **Certificates**: 365 days or before expiration
- **Service Account Keys**: 90 days

## üö® Incident Response

### Security Incident Classification

| Severity | Response Time | Escalation | Examples |
|----------|---------------|------------|----------|
| Critical | 15 minutes | CISO, CTO | Data breach, system compromise |
| High | 1 hour | Security team lead | Malware detection, unauthorized access |
| Medium | 4 hours | Security analyst | Policy violations, suspicious activity |
| Low | 24 hours | Security team | Minor vulnerabilities, configuration drift |

### Incident Response Playbook

# Automated alerting example
- name: Security Alert
  condition: security_event_detected
  actions:
